![theme]
  Indicates a sequence written for a particular novelty tip.

@[id]
  Indicates a sequence that was called at a particular dance.
  @x just says it was called at dance x.
  @x.y says it was the yth sequence called at dance x.
  @x.y.z says it was the zth sequence of the yth tip of dance x.

&[group].[index]
  Indicates that these sequences only work when glued together in this order.

Filters out sequences for all purposes:
  bad:   i just would not want to ever call this
  skip:  i no longer intend to call this
  worse: i have since written a better version of this
  todo:  needs work before being callable
  sus:   ???
  self:  for me, not for calling (e.g. mental image practice)
  no:    not intended for db, saved for other purposes

Other mechanical tags:
  noplayback: make it not try to plug it back into sd

Properties of sequences (suffix with copies of + or - as is sensible):
  [objective]
    asym:  asymmetric, i.e. cannot swap heads and sides
    bigon: only resolves in a bigon
  [difficulty]
    easy:  like, opening biggie level
    chal:  hard by normal means, e.g. parallelogram [c2 call] at c2
    weird: hard by nonstandard applications, e.g. crashing lockit at a2
    novel: hard by making stuff up, e.g. cuing
  [quality]
    pun:   some notable call/formation (eg cool double, 25% offset)
    joke:  funnier than a pun, very clearly the point, makes the dancers laugh
    cool:  impressive that it works

Documentation of some of my ad hoc tags:
  fcw: planned for fall challenge weekend 2023
  cc.n.m: challenge class week n part m
  teach: designed to teach a particular call
